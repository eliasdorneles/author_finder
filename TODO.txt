[X] implement something to extract all leaves
[X] check if target name appears in more than on leaf for some article
[X] try count vectorizer for feature extraction
    - q: how to evaluate?
        extract elements ->
            for each elem, extract features and feed SVM to classify into AUTHOR, OTHER
[X] create evaluation setup, measure avg precision, recall and f1 w/ cross validation
[X] inspect classifier weights manually
    did it, and results look not meaningful for positive cases:

[ ] add LabelKFold for proper cross-validation
[ ] have a look at the dataset, see where some of those words are coming from
[ ] try Logistic Regression, and have a look what it learns
[ ] have a look at ROC metrics:
